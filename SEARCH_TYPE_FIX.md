## ðŸ”§ **Search Type Filter Fix Applied**

### âœ… **Problem Fixed:**
When selecting "Notes Only", "Posts Only", or "Communities Only", the search was still showing results from other content types.

### âœ… **Solution Applied:**
1. **Clear All Results First** - Before any search, all result arrays are cleared
2. **Selective Population** - Only the selected content type is searched and populated
3. **Immediate Type Change** - When user changes search type, results update immediately
4. **Consistent Logic** - All search functions now use the same clearing logic

### ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now:**

| Selected Type | What Gets Searched | What Gets Displayed |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **All Content** | Notes + Posts + Communities | All results found |
| **Notes Only** | Notes only | Only notes results |
| **Posts Only** | Posts only | Only posts results |
| **Communities Only** | Communities only | Only communities results |

### ðŸ§ª **Test Instructions:**
1. Go to search page
2. Enter search term (e.g., "test")
3. Select "Notes Only" - should only show notes
4. Change to "Posts Only" - should immediately switch to only posts
5. Change to "Communities Only" - should only show communities
6. Change to "All Content" - should show all types

The search type filtering now works correctly and respects your selection!
