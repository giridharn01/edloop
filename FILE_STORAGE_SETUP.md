# 🎯 **Complete File Storage Setup Guide**

## 🆓 **Option 1: Cloudinary Setup (Recommended - FREE 10GB)**

### Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Click "Sign Up for Free"
3. Fill in your details (no credit card required)
4. Verify your email

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials
1. After login, go to your Dashboard
2. You'll see three important values:
   - **Cloud Name**: (e.g., "your-username")
   - **API Key**: (e.g., "123456789012345")
   - **API Secret**: (e.g., "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Edit your `backend/.env` file:
```env
# Replace with your actual Cloudinary credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
```

### Step 4: Update Notes Routes (Optional)
If you want to use Cloudinary for new uploads, update `backend/routes/notes.js`:

```javascript
// Replace the existing multer import with:
const { upload } = require('../services/cloudinaryService');

// The upload middleware will now save to Cloudinary instead of local storage
```

## 🏠 **Option 2: Local File Storage (Current Setup)**

Your current setup already works! I've added real sample files to demonstrate:

### What's Already Working:
✅ **Real Files Created**: 10 notes now have actual downloadable files
✅ **File Types**: PDF, TXT files with real content
✅ **Server Setup**: Files are served from `/sample-files/` endpoint

### Test Your Current Setup:
1. **Start your servers**:
   ```bash
   # Backend (if not running)
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Frontend (if not running)  
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit any note with attachments**:
   - Go to Notes page
   - Click on any note that shows "Attachments (1)" or more
   - Click "View" button on any attachment
   - The file should open/download!

### Sample Files Created:
- `lecture_notes.pdf` - Sample PDF with lecture content
- `cs101_lecture_notes.txt` - Computer Science notes
- `math_formulas.txt` - Mathematical formulas
- `physics_lab_report.txt` - Physics lab report
- `biology_study_guide.txt` - Biology study guide
- `psychology_research.txt` - Research paper
