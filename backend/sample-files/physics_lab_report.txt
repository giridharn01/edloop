Experiment: Measuring Acceleration Due to Gravity

Objective:
To determine the acceleration due to gravity using a pendulum.

Equipment:
- Simple pendulum
- Stopwatch
- Measuring tape
- Protractor

Procedure:
1. Set up pendulum with 1-meter string
2. Measure 10 oscillations for small angles
3. Record time and calculate period
4. Repeat for different lengths
5. Plot T² vs L graph

Results:
Length (m) | Period (s) | T² (s²)
0.5        | 1.42       | 2.01
0.7        | 1.68       | 2.82
1.0        | 2.01       | 4.04
1.2        | 2.20       | 4.84

Analysis:
From the slope of T² vs L graph:
g = 4π²/slope = 9.78 m/s²

Error: ±0.1 m/s² (1% accuracy)

Conclusion:
Measured value agrees with accepted value of g = 9.8 m/s²
