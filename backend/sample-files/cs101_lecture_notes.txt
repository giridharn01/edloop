Computer Science 101 - Lecture Notes
Week 5: Data Structures and Algorithms

Topics Covered:
1. Arrays and Linked Lists
2. Stack and Queue operations
3. Time complexity analysis
4. Basic sorting algorithms

Key Points:
- Arrays provide O(1) access time
- Linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation
- Stack follows LIFO principle
- Queue follows FIFO principle

Homework:
Implement a simple stack using arrays and demonstrate push/pop operations.

Next Week: We'll cover tree data structures and binary search algorithms.
