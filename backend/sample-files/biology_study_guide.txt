Biology 201 - Midterm Study Guide
Cell Biology and Genetics

Chapter 1: Cell Structure
- Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
- Organelles and their functions
- Cell membrane structure
- Transport mechanisms

Chapter 2: DNA and RNA
- DNA structure (double helix)
- Base pairing rules (A-T, G-C)
- Transcription process
- Translation and protein synthesis

Chapter 3: Cell Division
- Mitosis phases (PMAT)
- Meiosis and genetic variation
- Cell cycle regulation
- Cancer and cell cycle

Chapter 4: Genetics
- Mendel's laws
- Punnett squares
- Dominance patterns
- Linkage and crossing over

Key Terms:
- Chromosome, gene, allele
- Genotype vs phenotype
- Homozygous vs heterozygous
- Codominance and incomplete dominance

Practice Problems:
1. Cross AaBb Ã— AaBb, find phenotype ratio
2. Calculate map distance from recombination frequency
3. Identify inheritance pattern from pedigree
