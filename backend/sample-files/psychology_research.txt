The Impact of Social Media on Adolescent Mental Health

Abstract:
This study examines the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes in adolescents aged 13-18. A survey of 500 participants revealed significant correlations between excessive social media use and increased anxiety and depression symptoms.

Introduction:
Social media platforms have become integral to adolescent social interaction. However, concerns about their impact on mental health have emerged. This research investigates these effects through quantitative analysis.

Methodology:
- Participants: 500 adolescents (ages 13-18)
- Tools: PHQ-9 depression scale, GAD-7 anxiety scale
- Social media usage tracked via self-report
- Statistical analysis using SPSS

Results:
- 67% of participants use social media >3 hours/day
- Strong correlation (r=0.72) between usage and anxiety
- Depression scores 23% higher in heavy users
- Sleep quality inversely related to screen time

Discussion:
Results suggest that excessive social media use may contribute to mental health issues in adolescents. Potential mechanisms include social comparison, cyberbullying, and sleep disruption.

Limitations:
- Self-reported data may be biased
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Cross-sectional design limits temporal conclusions

Conclusion:
While social media offers benefits, moderated use is recommended for adolescent mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to establish causal relationships.
